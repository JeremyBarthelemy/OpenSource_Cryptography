Project currently UNDER HEAVY CONSTRUCTION!!!
More to come very soon!

Sandbox is to be used for posting test codes and for training/practice (i.e. teaching each other
how to use tools or program in various different languages and such).
Miscellaneous Crypto Tools will eventually be combined with greenflash to make an easily
accessible crypto suite! :)

Please include in your subject OpenSource Cryptography to make sure I don't accidentally erase it!
