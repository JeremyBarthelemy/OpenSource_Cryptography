The revised code was programmed in Java and debugged using the JCreatorLE development environment.
The purpose of the Java code was to generate test vectors for comparing with the ModelSim
waveform based upon various stimuli produced by the testbench.
Please note that in order to compile and run the Java code, it is necessary to change the name
of the file to "hash.java"
