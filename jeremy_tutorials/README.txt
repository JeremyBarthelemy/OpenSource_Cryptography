Posting basic VHDL and Verilog codes here for people interesting in learning the
basics! :)

A 16-bit AND gate was implemented in VHDL (code available in this directory) and the circuit
is also seen in the .png file.  The 16 bits of A and the 16 bits of B will be "ANDed"
together to produce the result 16 bits for C.
The same has been implemented in Verilog - also available in this folcer (.v extension).
Please note that typically VHDL and Verilog projects will be verified thoroughly with
testbenches and by other means to optimize for area, throughput, etc.
This code is just here to give you a little bit of an idea of these two languages. :)
